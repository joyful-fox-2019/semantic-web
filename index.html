                    <h1>What is toy photography?</h1>
                    <p>It's basically just a hobby that started because of another hobby. Some take it more seriously than others but in the end the goal is just about having fun.
                        I believe if you are a collector and you're reaching to the point that makes you want to do something with them you'll end up with this hobby and possibly love it more than just collecting.
                        If you think stuff like this require a lot of expensive stuff, you're not completely right.
                        Sure, there are a lot of people that own a bunch of diorama and mini studio, but we don't have to start from there.
                        If you're a cheap bastard like me you can read some tips to start making cool pics with cheap tools. :)

                <h2>Cheap Tools for Cool Toy Photography</h2><br>
                <h3>1. Backdrop (TV or laptop screen)</h3>
                <img id="image1" src="https://i2.wp.com/exclucollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_1230.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&ssl=1" class="rounded float-right" alt="Screen Backdrop">
                <p>This is perfect for you that don't want to go outside because you don't want to danger your collection or you're just a lazy person.
                The thing with using TV or laptop screen is it's really easy to set it up. You just have to turn your TV on and you're done.
                This would make your photos kinda look all the same, like mine, BUT you can pick any background you want from the internet. And I mean, ANY background.
                So, yeah, you're not gonna run out of ideas.</p>
                
                <br>
                <br>    
                <h3>2. RGB Light</h3>
                <p>This one is really important if you want to have more artistic result. You can make a lot of serious picture with a beautiful or dark tone.
                You can light a red or orange light to make glowing fire effect, or something like blue light to make a feel of pub and bar. A lot of possibilities.
                You don't have to buy the expensive one, just get the 5 bucks one and you're good to go. You can already do a lot of stuff with it.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Humidifier</h3>
                <p>One of the style that's really cool for toy photography is smoke effect. If you want to make some smoke effects, then this is the one to go with.
                    Smoke effects can add a lot of mysterious feel in your picture. You can use it in a battle scene like some ninjas or Batman using smoke bomb,
                    or you can just use it to add a more menacing feel to a place or some diorama you have. And also, humidifier still has its primary benefit, and that's to make your room stay humid.
                    So, win win!
                </p>

                <h3>4. Fun</h3>
                <p>Okay, as cheesy as it sounds, this is really what it's all about. You don't really need any tools to make you happy as long as you're having fun and enjoying the process.
                    To have more fun I recommend you to share it with the communities on the internet, a lot of us on instagram posting cool pictures everyday under the session tag from @toypops3, @toy_picasso and a lot of other toy communities.
                    So, yeah, hope you're enjoying this article and remember to keep having fun! :)
